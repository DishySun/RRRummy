For run:
Strategy 4 will check the number of the same color tile that is one number less or one number bigger, if the number is smaller than two, he wont play that set.
For example if strategy wants to play sets [O3,O4,O5], he will check the number of tile[O2] and tile[O6] with the same color, if there are less than two tile of them are on the table, he won't play, otherwise he plays this run.

For sets:
Strategy 4 will check the number of left color of the set, if the number of this tile on table is less than 2, he wont play, otherwise he plays this set.
For example if he wants to play set[R2 O2 B2],then it will check the number of tile[G2] on the table, if the number is less than two, he won't play this set, otherwise he plays.

When tiles in stock are left around 4-5, Strategy 4 will play as many melds as he can.
